# JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts

## By: Anthony Alicea

The _Course Code_ folder contains syntax notes and examples from various sections of the course.

The _index.html_ file does not have the files imported into it. Will need to import them as needed for review.

Also inside the _Course Code_ folder is a long file of notes. Some notes verbatim, for me to reference and review at later times as needed.
